### 1.Downloading Visual Studio
For this we will want to navigate [https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx](Here) and scroll down till we will see: "Community 2013 with Update 4" 
You may download an express version, but this will result in "Resharper" not being compatible with this version.

Next thing you will want to do is install. 
The installation may take up to 1 Hour, so please be patient :+1: 

After the installation is done you may be confused as to the installation path (i know i was)
For me it was: C:\Visual studio community 2013

But if you still did not manage to find it please navigate to Start->Search for Visual Studio

Now that we are done with the download we can start making our first project! which takes us to the second topic.
